# sorting-visualizer

A web application designed to demonstrate the functionality of various sorting algorithms. This serves as an educational resource to help users understand and visualize the mechanics of different sorting methods in a clear and interactive way.

## Implemented Algorithms
1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Selection Sort**
3. **Insertion Sort**
4. **Merge Sort**
5. **Quick Sort**
6. **Heap Sort**

## Features

### Visual Representation
- **Colored Coding of Operations**:
  - **Blue**: Default state of elements
  - **Yellow**: Elements currently being compared
  - **Red**: Elements identified for repositioning
  - **Green**: Elements placed in the correct position

### Controls for Customization
- **Speed of Visualization**: Adjust the animation speed with 5 available levels.
- **Data Size**: Vary the size of the data set to see how algorithms perform with different volumes of data.
- **Data Generation**: Randomly generate new data sets for varied experiences in each session.

### Insightful Information
- **Algorithm Complexity**: For each sorting algorithm, the visualizer displays its time and space complexity, providing deeper insight into its efficiency.
